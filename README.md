# UMSMarinesII
Source code for UMSMarinesII which is an edit of Asgards umsspacemarine mod for Unreal1998 and Unreal Tournament 1999

TO DEVELOPERS: if you are trying to cut down on file dependancies feel free to merge this with your mod. UMSMarinesII does not rely on anything but itself. Not even UPak. just remember to credit the mod somewhere!

NOTE: UMSMarinesII works for Version 226 of Unreal and Version 436 of Unreal Tournament. so if your project is on UT you can build this for that!
